# Pybfc, a Python Brainfuck Compiler

Run your esoteric programming language with an esoteric compiler! (Why would you write a compiler in Python??)

## "Features"

- Compiling Brainfuck to x86 fasm assembly (this means fasm is a dependency)
- Decent error messages ??
- Linux-only (sowwy, i'm writing assembly by hand)
- Yeah that's pretty much it

## Installation/Usage

Download the script and run it yourself :) I believe you'll need at least python 3.10

## Why???

Because I wanted to write something in Python (thank you boot.dev) and I wanted to write a compiler. But I barely know anything about compilers. Or assembly. So I should learn a lot. Brainfuck should be easy to parse since all the tokens are 1 character long, and theres only 8 of them. Simple.
